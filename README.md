# Zip Code Information

1. Fetched locations are stored inside the local storage 
2. Each result will be provided with the Google Map link but the location is searched on the basis of longitude and latitude provided by the API
3. I have used Axios for fetching the API
4. Some zip codes are in the format of characters keeping this in mind the Pincode input box is not set as a number type.
   
NOTE:
  the counties listed in the application are referred from the API's parent website https://api.zippopotam.us/
